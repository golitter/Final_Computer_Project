This was my first team programming ladder competition, and I missed the individual third prize by just one point, which is indeed a pity.

Especially when I found out that outputting “No Solution” for L3 would earn 2 points, and outputting 20 would earn 15 points, I felt even more upset (although it was due to my own lack of skill).

The issues exposed during today’s competition are as follows:

- Too slow in solving problems
- Lacking a sense of the problems
- Insufficient experience with the IO competition format

Possible reasons include:

- Not doing enough practice problems
- Not having done past CCCC problems, thus unaware of the difficulty
- Forgetting to score points strategically in the IO format

Solutions:

- If I aim to win a medal in ACM, I need to practice problems diligently every day, and reflect and summarize regularly. From now on, I will actively solve problems on Luogu and Codeforces. I plan to solve 30 problems a week, whether on Luogu, Nowcoder, or Codeforces.
- It is crucial to keep records, **reflect**, and **summarize**. My personal blog has a “Talk” feature where I will check in daily, documenting what I’ve learned and summarizing my experiences.
